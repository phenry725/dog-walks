# Dog Walking Calculator



We have a dog walker who isn't the most digital of a person. So, we kept having to go back and check out which days the walks had happened and we would frequently pay the dog walker incorrectly.

Now this program takes calendar events that have a certain prefix as a title ![Event Example](https://github.com/phenry725/dog-walks/blob/main/images/dogWalk.JPG?raw=true)
(default is "[DOG WALK]" but that is configurable) and counts them and applies the rate. Now, as long as you make sure the walks are accurate on the calendar, this should make sure the dog walker is paid correctly.
